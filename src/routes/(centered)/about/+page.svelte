        straight from xLights
      </li>

<h2>But FPP exists!</h2>

<p>
  It does and it has a LOT more features. LEDPlayr was born out of my frustration downloading a
  near 800MB docker image onto a storage and memory constrained RaspberryPi 3B and also my
  desire to learn rust. Those may not be particularly good reasons but we are where we are and I
  learnt a lot along the way ðŸ˜€ Hopefully someone else find use in my efforts.
